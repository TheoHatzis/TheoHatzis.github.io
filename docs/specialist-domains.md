## **Technical Focus & Specialist Surge Capacity**
{: .notice--info}

I provide high-level architectural oversight and "First-Silicon" triage for Tier 1 semiconductor ecosystems. My focus is on ensuring critical customer milestones are met through rigorous validation and precision hardware stabilization.

### 🏗️ **Architecture & Design Authority**
Orchestrating board-level architecture for high-density consumer and industrial silicon. I provide the "Design Authority" required to move from initial requirements to "Golden" PCB status.
* **Pre-Lab Heritage:** Validating next-generation architectures for **Apple** consumer ecosystems (via Dialog/Renesas) before they exit the laboratory environment.
* **Strategic Value:** Ensuring system coherence across PMIC, ADC, and power-path interfaces to prevent architectural drift during the prototype phase.

### ✅ **Post-Silicon Validation (V&V)**
Specializing in the critical "Bring-up" phase where silicon meets physical reality. Expert in the triage and characterization of complex **PMU/PMIC** and **BOOST** devices.
* **Triage Under Pressure:** Identifying and resolving silicon-to-board parasitic issues to hit aggressive tape-out and verification windows.
* **Correlation Expertise:** Bridging the gap between lab measurements and simulation models to ensure 100% compliance with strict customer performance specifications.

### ⚡ **Power Systems (SiC / GaN / High-Voltage)**
Expert validation of high-frequency power stages and gate drivers. My work focuses on the transition to Wide Bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, ensuring thermal stability and switching precision.
* **Key Pedigree:** Technical characterization for **Infineon** and **Texas Instruments** power ecosystems.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Identifying parasitic inductances and EMI bottlenecks in EV and industrial power modules to ensure "First-Time-Right" integration.

### 🔋 **Batteries & Energy Storage**
Specialist in the characterization of battery management systems (BMS) and nanopower architectures for mobile and wearable technology.
* **EIS & Diagnostics:** Deep-dive into **Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)** for state-of-health (SoH) and state-of-charge (SoC) accuracy.
* **Efficiency:** Optimizing nanopower architectures for high-efficiency consumer electronics, drawing on a heritage of precision PMIC validation.

### **EMEA Engagement & Compliance**
* **Mobility:** Dual UK/EU nationality (Greek passport in process) for frictionless on-site triage.
* **Tax Status:** Fully registered for **VAT/Income Tax in Germany (2024/25)** and operating via **Outside IR35 (SOW/PSC)** frameworks in the UK.
