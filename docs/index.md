## **About Me**

I’m a hardware‑first engineer specialising in semiconductor validation, mixed‑signal power systems, and system‑level triage. My career spans two decades across the Munich semiconductor ecosystem (Freising, Germering, Nürnberg), Denmark, and the UK.

I’m known for resolving elusive silicon issues, stabilising complex hardware platforms, and bringing clarity to systems under stress. During my time at Ericsson in Nürnberg, I earned the nickname **“Der Fuchs”** — *the fox who finds the flaw no one else sees [our clever fox]* — a reflection of my diagnostic intuition and ability to deliver under pressure.

My banner imagery — an **Ibex perched on a mountain cliff at sunset** — symbolises the dual nature of my work:

- the **Fox** at the coalface, solving what others miss  
- the **Ibex**, surveying the full system landscape with quiet precision  

I operate flexibly across **SOW‑aligned engagements** and **Fixed‑Term Contracts**, providing structured technical grids, validation matrices, and milestone‑driven outcomes.

## **Engagement Model**

### **SOW‑Aligned**
Deliverables‑driven, milestone‑based, with a technical grid defining scope, acceptance criteria, and measurable outcomes.

### **Fixed‑Term Contracts**
Rapid integration into existing teams, stabilising hardware, accelerating validation, and supporting programme milestones.

## **Endnote**

The moniker **“Der Fuchs”** originated from my time contracting at Ericsson in Germany. It reflects the idiom **“Der Fuchs findet den Fehler, den keiner sieht” — the fox finds the flaw no one else sees [our clever fox]**, a recognition of my ability to resolve elusive issues in high‑pressure environments. I was retained for four years, with additional budget pulled to keep me on the programme — a rare commitment in a contractor environment and a reflection of the value I delivered.
