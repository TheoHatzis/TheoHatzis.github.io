## Theo Hatzis
### Senior Electronics Architect & Semiconductor Validation Specialist  
 _“Der Fuchs” — the fox who finds the flaw no one else sees_

---

## **About Me**
I focus on hardware engineering, specialising in semiconductor validation, mixed-signal power systems, and system-level triage. Over two decades, I have built my career across the Munich semiconductor ecosystem, Denmark, and around Oxford in the Thames Valley, UK.

During my time at Ericsson in Nürnberg, I earned the nickname **“Der Fuchs”** — *the fox who finds the flaw no one else sees* — a reflection of my diagnostic creative solving problem intuition and the ability to deliver under hard real-time pressures.

## **Core Expertise**
- **Post‑Silicon Validation:** PMIC/PMU, PVT corners, and silicon‑to‑model correlation.
- **Mixed‑Signal & Power:** Buck/Boost, GaN/SiC gate drivers, and multiphase converters.
- **Automation & Data:** Python (PyVISA, Pandas, NumPy, Pytest, Plotly).
