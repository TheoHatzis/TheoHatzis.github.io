**The Summit View:** From the high-altitude perspective of an Architect, 
the goal is not just to see the circuit, but to understand the entire ecosystem. 
As the Ibex watches the valley, I oversee the intersection of hardware, 
software, and power to ensure architectural grace.

### Senior Electronics Architect & Semiconductor Validation Specialist  
_“Der Fuchs” — the fox who finds the flaw no one else sees_

## **About Me**
I focus on hardware engineering, specializing in semiconductor validation, mixed-signal power systems, and system-level triage. Over two decades, I have built my career across the Munich semiconductor ecosystem, Denmark, and the Thames Valley 'Silicon Hub' in the UK.

During my time at Ericsson in Nürnberg, I earned the nickname **“Der Fuchs”** — *the fox who finds the flaw no one else sees*. This reflects a diagnostic intuition, creative problem-solving, and the delivery of elegant solutions and applications under hard real-time pressures.

## **Engineering Applications**
* **Post‑Silicon Validation:** PMIC/PMU, PVT corners, and silicon‑to‑model correlation.
* **Mixed‑Signal & Power:** Buck/Boost, GaN/SiC gate drivers, and multiphase converters.
* **Automation & Data:** Python-driven analysis (PyVISA, Pandas, NumPy, Pytest).
* **Mentorship:** Guiding students and junior engineers through the complexities of the semiconductor landscape.
