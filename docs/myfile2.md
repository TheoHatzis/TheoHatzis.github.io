## **Endnote**

The moniker **“Der Fuchs”** originated from my time contracting at Ericsson in Germany. It reflects the idiom **“Der Fuchs findet den Fehler, den keiner sieht” — the fox finds the flaw no one else sees [our clever fox]**, a recognition of my ability to resolve elusive issues in high‑pressure environments. I was retained for four years, with additional budget pulled to keep me on the programme — a rare commitment in a contractor environment and a reflection of the value I delivered.
