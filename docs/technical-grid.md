# **TECHNICAL EXPERTISE & PROJECT DELIVERY MATRIX**

| **Domain** | **Specialist “Surge Capacity” Deliverables** | **Strategic Value (The “Fox” Factor)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Electronics & Hardware Systems** | **Board‑Level Architecture:** Power‑path design, mixed‑signal interfaces, embedded bring‑up, and stabilisation of complex hardware platforms. | **System Coherence:** Establishes a stable electronics foundation for PMIC, ADC, and power‑stage validation across full product cycles. |
| **Post‑Silicon Validation (V&V)** | **Expert Bring‑up & Triage:** Full characterisation of complex **PMU/PMIC** and **BOOST** devices. Expert in PVT corner validation and silicon‑to‑model correlation. | **Risk Mitigation:** Identifying architectural flaws during initial bring‑up to prevent costly silicon re‑spins and tape‑out delays. |
| **Precision Analogue & Mixed‑Signal** | **ASIC & Sensor Interfaces:** Specialist in low‑noise front‑ends, **Delta‑Sigma ADCs**, and MEMS sensor evaluation (pressure/inertial). | **Efficiency:** Optimising nanopower architectures for wearable and mobile display tech (**Apple/Dialog/Renesas** heritage). |
| **Power Electronics & SiC** | **High‑Voltage Gate Drivers:** Validation and verification of **SiC/GaN Gate Drivers**. Verification of power stages for EV and industrial applications. | **Specialist Insight:** Deep understanding of high‑frequency switching parasitics and thermal management in power modules. |
| **System Diagnostics (The Fuchs)** | **High‑Level Debug:** Rapid root‑cause analysis of non‑obvious board‑level parasitics and EMI/EMC issues that stall production. | **“The Fox” Intuition:** 25+ years of diagnostic memory to solve “unsolvable” hardware bugs that junior teams struggle to isolate. |
| **Automation & Tooling** | **Python/MATLAB Frameworks:** Development of robust, scalable test automation suites (Pytest/PyVISA) for accelerated characterisation. | **Speed to Market:** Replacing slow manual bench testing with automated suites to hit aggressive smartphone/consumer launch windows. |

### **Engagement Standards**
All technical deliverables are mapped to specific **Acceptance Criteria (AC)** defined at the start of the engagement. Whether operating under an **SOW** or **FTC**, I provide structured updates, validation reports, and raw data correlation to ensure full transparency of the "Silicon to System" status.
