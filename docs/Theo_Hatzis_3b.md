# Summary

Summary
Engineer with 30y++ experience in hardware development with OrCAD, Protel (aka Altium), Mentor Schematic capture etc., on microprocessor based applications, interfaces and sensors for medical, scientific, wireless terminals, traffic surveying equipment. In mid-career, developed the communications "outstations" equipment racks of the MIDAS subsystem that was first deployed on the UK's M25 Controlled-Motorways pilot project automatic incidents detection and variable speed signalling systems.

Recent freelance projects include the schematic design on 3G/4G early access devices, Validation and Design Verification on 3G and LTE Modems, PMU, PA, RF Transceivers, and post-silicon automation and manual testing on PMU, PMIC, DCDC, Charge Pumps and Buck/Boost devices, with automation in Python, C#, Teststand and LabVIEW.
