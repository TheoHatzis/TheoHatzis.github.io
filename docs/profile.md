# Der Fuchs: Finding the flaw no one else sees.

As a multidisciplinary engineer with 20+ years at the coalface of hardware engineering, I provide the diagnostic intuition required to resolve complex system challenges. I specialise in **semiconductor validation**, **mixed-signal/power electronics**, and **system-level triage**.

The Ibex watches from above; the Fuchs works the details below.

### Regional Expertise
My work spans the core of the Western electronics industry:
* **DACH:** The Munich semiconductor ecosystem.
* **Nordics:** Denmark's power electronics corridor.
* **UK:** The Thames Valley ‘Magnet’ and the ‘Silicon Hub.’

### Technical Focus

* **Post-Silicon Validation:** PMIC/PMU, PVT corners, and rigorous silicon-to-model correlation.
* **Mixed-Signal & Power:** Buck/Boost, GaN/SiC gate drivers, and multiphase converters.
* **Automation:** Full-stack data analysis using Python (PyVISA, Pandas, NumPy, Pytest).
* **Mentorship:** Elevating junior engineers through architectural discipline.

### Domain Depth

* **Power & Energy:** Advanced GaN/SiC topologies and BMS state-of-health characterisation (EIS).
* **Safety-Critical Systems:** Navigating ISO 26262 (Auto), ISO 13485 (Med), and TRG 1068 (UK Infrastructure).
* **Scientific Diagnostics:** Merging physical chemistry and spectroscopy with MedTech, photonics (SPAD/dToF), and instrumentation.

### Availability & Logistics

I operate as an elite specialist available for **SOW (Statement of Work)** or **FTC (Fixed Term Contract)** engagements. I focus on high-impact "bursts" where architectural integrity is at risk. 

* **Location:** Temporarily based in Wiltshire, UK (BRS–OXF–BHX corridor).
* **Mobility:** Dual UK/EU national. Available for deployment across **EU, DACH, and EMEA**.
* **Security:** SC Cleared (lapsed) for Missile Subsystems and Space Tech.

**Selected Project History:**
*ST-Ericsson, Dialog Semiconductor, Renesas, Texas Instruments, Intel Mobile, Infineon.*
