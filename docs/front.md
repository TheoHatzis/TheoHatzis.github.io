Excellent — I’ll produce the **fully revised matrix** with a new, top‑level **Electronics & Hardware Systems** row, written in clean British English, aligned with your Senior Electronics Architect identity, and consistent with the tone of your existing site.

This version is ready to drop straight into your Jekyll index.md or technical‑grid.md.

# **TECHNICAL EXPERTISE & PROJECT DELIVERY MATRIX (Revised with Electronics Domain)**

|**Domain**|**Specialist “Surge Capacity” Deliverables**|**Strategic Value (The “Fox” Factor)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Electronics & Hardware Systems**|**Board‑Level Architecture:** Power‑path design, mixed‑signal interfaces, embedded bring‑up, and stabilisation of complex hardware platforms.|**System Coherence:** Establishes a stable electronics foundation for PMIC, ADC, and power‑stage validation across full product cycles.|
|**Post‑Silicon Validation (V&V)**|**Expert Bring‑up & Triage:** Full characterisation of complex **PMU/PMIC** and **BOOST** devices. Expert in PVT corner validation and silicon‑to‑model correlation.|**Risk Mitigation:** Identifying architectural flaws during initial bring‑up to prevent costly silicon re‑spins and tape‑out delays.|
|**Precision Analogue & Mixed‑Signal**|**ASIC & Sensor Interfaces:** Specialist in low‑noise front‑ends, **Delta‑Sigma ADCs**, and MEMS sensor evaluation (pressure/inertial).|**Efficiency:** Optimising nanopower architectures for wearable and mobile display tech (heritage in Apple/Dialog/Renesas projects).|
|**Power Electronics & SiC**|**High‑Voltage Gate Drivers:** Validation and verification of **SiC/GaN Gate Drivers**. Verification of power stages for EV and industrial applications.|**Specialist Insight:** Deep understanding of high‑frequency switching parasitics and thermal management in power modules.|
|**System Diagnostics (The Fuchs Persona)**|**High‑Level Debug:** Rapid root‑cause analysis of non‑obvious board‑level parasitics and EMI/EMC issues that stall production.|**“The Fox” Intuition:** 25+ years of diagnostic memory to solve “unsolvable” hardware bugs that junior teams struggle to isolate.|
|**Automation & Tooling**|**Python/MATLAB Frameworks:** Development of robust, scalable test automation suites (Pytest/PyVISA) for accelerated characterisation.|**Speed to Market:** Replacing slow manual bench testing with automated suites to hit aggressive smartphone/consumer launch windows.|

This version does three important things:

- **Electronics** becomes a first‑class domain, not an implied background.
- The matrix now mirrors your title: _Senior Electronics Architect_.
- Recruiters scanning the page immediately see your hardware breadth before diving into validation depth.

If you want, I can also update the **shorter matrix** at the top of your page so both grids stay consistent.
