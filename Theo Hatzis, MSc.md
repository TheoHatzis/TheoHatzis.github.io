# Summary

Engineer 30y++ experience in hardware development with OrCAD, Protel (now Altium), Mentor Schematic capture etc., for micros applications and interfaces, and sensors. Recent projects include Validation and Design Verification on 3G and LTE Modems, PMU, PA, RF Transceivers and work on post silicon manual and automated testing on PMU, PMIC, DCDC, CP, Buck/Boost converters etc.

Speciality work in semiconductors labs includes automation of highly repetitive measurements, temperature and characterisation, issues assessment and competitive analysis. Development of high-speed Forcing's circuits e.g. programmable trapezoid pulse and triangular loads in DCDC and LDO transient validation studies. Wide DCDC measurement measurements coverage, includes register I2C and Test-mode access via C-microcontroller and VISA. Experience of bench automation with Teststand and Adapters; Python, PyVISA, Python libraries includes Pandas, Numpy, Jinja2 and YAML. Use of Test API/SDK and Frame-works; and MSOffice automation via C#/.NET and Python. Other recent work includes development of high-current battery test-loads and other forcing circuits.

I'm available on a B2B basis or with contracting partner -- freelance activities only. My vat registration number is USt-IdNr: DE259921718. Language Spoken: English
