**The Summit View:** From the high-altitude perspective of an Architect, the goal is not just to see the circuit, but to understand the entire ecosystem. As the Ibex watches the valley, I oversee the intersection of hardware, software, and power to ensure architectural grace.


## Theo Hatzis
### Senior Electronics Architect & Semiconductor Validation Specialist  
_“Der Fuchs” — the fox who finds the flaw no one else sees_

## **About Me**
I focus on hardware engineering, specialising in semiconductor validation, mixed-signal power systems, and system-level triage. Over two decades, I have built my career across the Munich semiconductor ecosystem, Denmark, and the Thames Valley 'Silicon Hub' in the UK.

During my time at Ericsson in Nürnberg, I earned the nickname **“Der Fuchs”** — *the fox who finds the flaw no one else sees*. This reflects a diagnostic intuition and creative problem-solving, and the delivery of elegant solutions and applications under hard real-time RMS pressures.

## **Engineering Applications**
* **Post‑Silicon Validation:** PMIC/PMU, PVT corners, and silicon‑to‑model correlation.
* **Mixed‑Signal & Power:** Buck/Boost, GaN/SiC gate drivers, and multiphase converters.
* **Automation & Data:** Python-driven analysis (PyVISA, Pandas, NumPy, Pytest).
* **Mentorship:** Guiding students and junior engineers through the complexities of the semiconductor landscape.

### **High-Altitude Architectural Oversight**
* **Silicon Triage:** Specialising in the "Der Fuchs" methodology—identifying elusive system-level stressors and PVT corner exceptions that automated V&V often misses.
* **Measurement-Driven Engineering:** Bridging the gap between physical-layer behaviour and silicon reliability, from sub-picoampere sensor interfaces to high-speed digital integrity.

### **Specialised Domain Expertise**
* **Power & Energy Systems:** Advanced validation of GaN/SiC topologies, multiphase DCDC converters, and BMS state-of-health (SoH) characterisation using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).
* **Safety-Critical Systems:** Navigating complex regulatory landscapes including ISO 26262 (Automotive), ISO 13485 (Medical), and TRG 1068 (UK Infrastructure).
* **Multidisciplinary Diagnostic Intuition:** Leveraging a foundation in Physical Chemistry and Spectroscopy to resolve root-cause failures in MedTech, Photonics (SPAD/dToF), and Scientific Instrumentation.
